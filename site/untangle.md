# Untangle

A relaxing de-cluttering game.

## How to play

You are given a number of points, some of which have lines drawn between them. You can move the points about arbitrarily; your aim is to position the points so that no line crosses another.

**Controls**: Select a point by tapping or clicking on it, then drag it to a new position.

## Source Code

You can find the game's source code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Mota-Link/untangle-rs).
